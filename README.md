# Study-Manager
This app is writen 100% in Java as an Android App
I wrote this app when I am 3rd year student at University of Manitoba. 
The app has featrues:

- Create class scheulde automatically based on the start time and end time of the whole course period from user.
- GPA Planner helps student to know how much more grade they need to get to acheive their desired final grade based on grades they have achieved so far.
- Create a task list for student to mark what they need to do and when they have done.
- Email function to allow user to send email through Gmail.
- Create note for classes by typing


Upcoming features that I am developong now:
- Take Note by taking picture or import picture from the phone
- Change the app theme with some Color options
