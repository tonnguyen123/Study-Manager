# The Course Manager - study planning app Vision Statement

## Primary stakeholders 
The course manager application is designed for students (primarily target students in high school and university/college) to manage their study schedule.

## Goal
The goal os this application is to create a system which help students manage their study and Students are able to structure their personal schedules, keep track of their progressing classes and make progress for their study by using this application.

## Description
The application will feature the ability to help students find the time and instructor for the classes they are going to take, find out their current grade, GPA and the amount of grade they need to obtain in the future to reach the goal they have set, and take and save notes so that can be used to share their study progress or to review for tests preparation.

The application will show all the available instructors who will be teaching the course that semester after receiving information from the student. It would also provide the section numbers next to the course that is listed so that students can easily pick and take the course that best suits their situation. Students are also provided with the features that allow them to input the important dates for their selected courses, such as the deadline for the assignment, upcoming quizzes, and their customized events such as breaking works into different tasks and split the tasks among a period of time to the calendar to keep track of all the activities.

In order to reduce the amount of work for students to worry about their grades, the course manager application will let them input the weight and grade for each assignment, quiz and test, and calculate the amount of future grade they need to get everytime they open the GPA calculator page or update their grade.Students can also set different goals for grade to see the different minimum amount of future grade they need to get in order to reach their goal. Students are also able to directly email their instructor directly from the application for help without jumping out to other email applications.

The calendar page of the application is not only clickable for adding events, but also able to let students save and share their notes. Students can find their scheduled course on the calendar and save class notes if needed. Students can also upload picture formed notes instead of traditional typed notes. Saved notes can be easily shared with other students that are also using this application for better peer studying.

## Branching Strategy
The Branching Strategy we are going to use is Git Flow. We will be seperating works from the main branch and merge back to the main branch once the works is finished. We found that this is best suit for our situation for this project, and the cost for merging branches are very cheap. Also, split works to everyone can push our progress move forward faster and safer for preventing errors.

## Value
The use of this kind of application that combines all benefits from several other applications that only does few things to help students manage their courses is the central idea. By containing a detailed summary of courses, schedules, plans for students to keep track of the progress of their study and manage their notes by using only one application make the course management application valuable.
